# Physics Animations

A few experiments of animation of simple physics systems, tipycally via the numerical solution of systema of ordinary differential equations.

* [Simple pendulum: small-angle vs full solution](Simple%20Pendolum.ipynb)
* Simple pendulum: dissipative dumping term
* Double pendolum: chaos!
* Projectile motion with drag
